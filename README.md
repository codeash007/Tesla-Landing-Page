# Tesla Landing Page

This project is a dynamic and interactive landing page inspired by Tesla's product showcase. It features a hero slider that highlights different Tesla models with engaging animations and key specifications. The design focuses on a modern, clean aesthetic, providing an immersive user experience.




## Tech Stack

This project leverages a combination of modern web technologies and libraries to create its interactive experience:

*   **HTML5**: Provides the foundational structure of the landing page.
*   **CSS3**: Used for styling, layout, and animations, contributing to the sleek and modern look.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Powers the dynamic functionality, including the slider logic and interactive elements.
*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used here to create the component-based structure of the slider and its elements.
*   **React Transition Group**: A set of components for managing component transition states, enabling smooth entry and exit animations for the slider elements.
*   **Prop-Types**: A runtime type checking for React props, used for validation and ensuring correct data flow.
*   **Lodash**: A JavaScript utility library providing helper functions for common programming tasks, potentially used for data manipulation or utility functions within the project.
*   **Bezier-Easing**: A JavaScript library for creating custom bezier easing functions, likely used to define the sophisticated animation curves for the slider transitions.




## Professional Setup and Usage

To set up and run this project professionally, follow these steps:

### 1. Project Structure

The project has a straightforward structure:

```
tesla-landing-page/
└── dist/
    ├── index.html
    ├── script.js
    └── style.css
```

- The `dist/` directory contains all the necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the landing page.

### 2. Running the Project

This is a client-side web application and does not require a backend server for basic functionality. You can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

**Option 1: Directly Open `index.html`**

Navigate to the `dist` directory and open `index.html` with your preferred web browser. For example, if using a command line:

```bash
# For macOS/Linux
open dist/index.html

# For Windows
start dist/index.html
```

**Option 2: Using a Local Web Server (Recommended for Professional Development)**

For professional development and to ensure all assets load correctly, it is highly recommended to serve the files using a local web server. Here are a few common methods:

#### Using Python's Built-in HTTP Server

If you have Python installed, you can quickly spin up a simple HTTP server:

```bash
cd tesla-landing-page/dist
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Using Node.js `http-server` (if Node.js is installed)

First, install `http-server` globally (if you haven't already):

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

Then, navigate to your project's `dist` directory and start the server:

```bash
cd tesla-landing-page/dist
http-server
```

This will typically serve the application on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 3. Interacting with the Landing Page

Once the page is loaded in your browser:

- **Explore the Slider**: The main feature is the interactive hero slider. You can navigate through different Tesla models (Model S, Model X, Model 3, Roadster, Semi truck) to see their unique designs and specifications.
- **View Car Details**: Each slide presents key performance indicators such as top speed, 0-60 mph acceleration, and mile range.
- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes for an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
